This script is used to download the JSON files for match IDs provided in the
Riot Api 2.0 Challenge zipfile. Only ranked matches from NA, EUW, EUNE, and KR
are downloaded. Files are sorted by region and then by patch. Also organizes
match IDs into a pandas DataFrame and saves this as a csv for future reference.
